## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

On this project, I was reminded about the use of maxLength as property to limit input entries. I played around with regex testing and matching and I learned the match() string method is best to use on this project. Additionally I stumbled upon the keyup and keydown events, I tried to maximize but on some aspect its less optimal. Probably on some instances where live events are required.  


### Continued development

At the moment I feel my coding in javascript and css are still a bit redundant. After this project I'm going to sift through my previous projects and try to refactor my code as best as possible.

## Acknowledgments

The courses I have undergone in Udemy with Dr. Angela is helping me a lot. Had couple of notes during that bootcamp and I'm now they are helping a lot since I can't remember most of the syntaxes.
